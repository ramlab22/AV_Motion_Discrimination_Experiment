function [newx, newy] = targetPosits(x, y, direction)
% TARGETPOSITS gives xy coordinates for any direction
%
% newxy = targetPosits(x, y, direction)
%
%   gives xy coordinates for any direction, given coordinates that set the
%   distance. For example, if you want the x and y coordinates for 90 degrees, 
%   at the same distance as [2,3] is from [-1,-4], then input 
%       newxy = targetPosits([2,3], [-1,-4], 90) 
%   and it will give x and y coordinates with center at xy(2,-1). Only looks at 
%   the first to x and y coordinates for the distance measure, but makes as many 
%   targets as directions given.
